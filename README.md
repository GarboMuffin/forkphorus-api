# trampoline

Web service that proxies the Scratch API for use in web services such as [forkphorus](https://forkphorus.github.io) or [TurboWarp](https://turbowarp.org).

It uses heavy caching (browser and server level) and request throttling to reduce the amount of requests sent to the upstream Scratch API.

An instance of this service is hosted at https://trampoline.turbowarp.org/
